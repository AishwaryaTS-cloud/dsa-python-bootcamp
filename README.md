# Data Structures & Algorithms in Python — My Learning Journey

This repository contains my notes, code, and progress as I work through a complete Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) bootcamp using Python.

My goal is to build strong fundamentals, learn how each data structure works internally, and become confident in solving coding problems.

## 🎓 Course Reference

I am following this course while building the repo:

**Data Structures and Algorithms Python: The Complete Bootcamp**

**Comprehensive Data Structures and Algorithms Guide: Learn, Visualize and Implement DSA Concepts from Basics to Advanced**

**Created by Shubham Sarda**

## 🚀 Why This Repo Exists

I’m treating this as my personal workspace where I:

- Understand concepts from scratch
- Implement every data structure and algorithm myself
- Practice problem-solving in Python
- Build clean, readable code
- Track my learning progress

## 📝 Notes

This isn’t meant to be perfect.

It’s a learning journal — expect rough drafts, rewrites, and improvements as I grow.
